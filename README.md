WordBubble is a word typing game where you have to type words that start with some characters.
It's quite fun to play, and it may also make you recall words faster - practice makes a man perfect!

**How to run:**
To run this source code **main.rb**, you will first need Ruby and the Ruby2D gem. After that, just run the `main.rb` file, which is the main source code file.

**How to play:**

You will be given a short word. For example, you may see the word 'lo' and you have to type words that start with lo - long, longer, longest, lot, lots, look, looked, looking, loom - and so on!

You can press *y*, *left shift*, *left arrow*, *enter* keys on the confirmation window to quit, or press *n*, *right shift*, *right arrow*, *space* for not to quit!
